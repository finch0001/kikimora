# Kikimora

## In one sentence
Kikimora is an OSM editor for non-techies.

## Motivation
OpenStreetMap is a world-wide community effort to map the world. There are currently [three main-editors](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editors#Top three editors) as well as a bunch of other, less-used editors. All these editors have one common problem: They are geared towards the professional mapper. Thus, they require a deep understanding of OSM mapping and tagging in order to be able to add or edit OSM data. 
This is a useful approach for simplifying the mapping process for advanced mappers who need an editor for intense mapping sessions.
However, it is completely unacceptable for tech-averse one-time mappers. To give you an example: Johnny, an entrepreneur, just opened a restaurant and would like to add his restaurant to OpenStreetMap, because a friend of him told him to do so. Right now, he first needs to register at OSM. If he doesn't give up at that point already, he needs to enter the editor. Now he is confronted with a mapping tutorial. Assuming that Johnny is really motivated he finishes the tutorial and successfully adds an OSM node for his restaurant. Next he will have to add the proper tags. He has nothing better to do today anyway, so he fights his way through the hundreds of [map features](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) and even manages to sort out the [opening hours format](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours). Needless to say, that all this ain't gonna happen and Johnny will most probably give up already at the registration page.
To improve this situation, OSM editors must be dedicated to specific use-cases and make it extremely easy for non-tech-people to enter data. 

## About
Kikimora is a modern approach to make a super-simple POI-editor for OSM, that everyone can use. It uses-applied machine-learning techniques, to automatically extract OSM information so the user doesn't have to do much more than confirming the data. 

## Features
This is an initial prototype that is still in its infancy. It is developed as the bachelor thesis of [ErnaF](https://github.com/ErnaF). Currently supported features:
- Automatic prediction of the cuisine tag for restaurants
- Adding / editing tags
- Pushing data back to OSM (currently only via login)
